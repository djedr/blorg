		<p>This is a rough list of some of the projects and work I've been involved with. The list contains descriptions of each project, various languages and technologies that I had some contact with in the scope of the project, links to resources related to the project (including source code where available) as well as other relevant information. The list is ordered by category (professional, non-professional, other) and year (most recent first).</p>
		<p>Note: this list is under active development.</p>
